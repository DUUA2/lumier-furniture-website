### ‚úÖ REPLIT PROMPT TO FIX DATABASE CONNECTION & PRODUCT FETCHING

````
I‚Äôm working on a full-stack project using Express, Drizzle ORM, and PostgreSQL.

My app is deployed on Render, and my database is hosted on Render as well. Locally and in Replit, I'm running into this persistent error:

‚ùå `{ "error": "Failed to fetch products" }`

### Project Setup:
- Backend: Express + Drizzle ORM
- DB: PostgreSQL from Render
- Schema: `shared/schema.ts` exists with a valid `products` table definition.
- DB config is in `drizzle.config.ts` and references `process.env.DATABASE_URL`.
- The route trying to fetch is `/api/products`
- I‚Äôve seeded the DB with 20+ sample products in `seed.ts` using `await db.insert(products).values(sampleProducts)`
- I use `npx drizzle-kit introspect` and migrations are working
- The DB seeding logs `‚úÖ Database seeded successfully...`
- Still, hitting `/api/products` returns a 500 error with ‚ÄúFailed to fetch products‚Äù

### My suspicions:
1. `products` import in the route file may be broken ‚Äî currently using:
   ```ts
   import { products } from "@shared/schema";
````

But maybe should be:

```ts
import { products } from "../shared/schema";
```

2. The `tsconfig.json` paths might be misconfigured or not supported in Replit:

   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "baseUrl": ".",
       "paths": {
         "@shared/*": ["shared/*"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. My `.env` contains:

   ```
   AUTH_DISABLED=true
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<actual-render-db-url>
   ```

4. I‚Äôve confirmed the table exists and the structure is correct via `drizzle-kit introspect`.

### What I need help with:

* Ensure the import of `products` in `routes/products.ts` (or wherever) is correctly using relative path if aliases aren‚Äôt supported.
* Verify `.env` vars are actually being loaded by Drizzle and Express in Replit.
* Ensure that my Express app is correctly using the seeded database.
* Help diagnose any build/runtime issues preventing the `/api/products` endpoint from working.

Please walk me through whatever I‚Äôm missing so I can get this route to return product data successfully.

Let me know if you'd like me to **test the prompt** or tailor it to your specific folder structure.
