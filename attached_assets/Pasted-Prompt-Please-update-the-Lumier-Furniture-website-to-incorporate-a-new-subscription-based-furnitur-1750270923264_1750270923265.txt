Prompt:

Please update the Lumier Furniture website to incorporate a new subscription-based furniture rental model. This update should include the following elements:

1. Subscription Plans Page
Create a dedicated page outlining our new subscription tiers.

Each tier should detail:

Number and type of furniture pieces included

Monthly pricing

Flexibility to swap or upgrade items periodically (e.g. every 3 or 6 months)

Perks like free delivery, free maintenance, and optional insurance.

2. Interactive Showroom / AR Integration
Integrate a virtual showroom or augmented reality (AR) feature that lets customers visualize how furniture would look in their actual living space.

This feature should be accessible from:

Product pages

Subscription plan page

"Try before you commit" section (if applicable)

3. Sustainability Highlight
Add a section on the homepage and subscription page emphasizing Lumier Furniture’s eco-conscious commitment.

Mention how the subscription model promotes:

Sustainable reuse

Reduced furniture waste

Support for local artisans using eco-friendly materials

4. Customization Options
On every relevant product page, include the ability to:

Choose fabric, color, finish, or layout

View those changes in real time (optional)

Ensure this is available for both subscription and purchase customers.

5. Customer Support and Subscription FAQ
Update the FAQ and support pages to cover:

How the subscription model works

How to request maintenance, upgrades, or cancellations

Delivery and return policies

Terms for swapping items and insurance details

6. Checkout Flow
Customers should be able to choose between three options:

Outright purchase

Installment plan (2–24 months, 5% monthly fee, verified with ID + credit check)

Subscription model (monthly fee, with perks)

Show the price breakdown based on the option selected.

Include a toggle for insurance opt-in at checkout.

Ensure customers agree to terms and conditions before completing checkout.

7. Backend and Admin Controls
Add backend tools for:

Managing subscription tiers

Tracking swap/upgrade requests

Managing customer preferences

Turning insurance options on/off per item

Final Notes:
Ensure the design and flow align with Lumier Furniture’s brand: modern, clean, bohemian + hotel-luxury inspired. Make the interface smooth, mobile-friendly, and visually rich.
